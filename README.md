# Abstract
BELIEFS ABOUT THE AGENCY OF OTHERS IMPACTS HOW LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES VIEW THE POTENTIAL OF SOCIETY

Brendan K. Molinar, B.S., M.S.

Political partisans on both the left and the right in the United States have different visions of human nature and our potential to improve society. To date, however, very little research has examined the relationship between political ideology and positive potential â€“ the potential for society to improve. The research presented here aimed to identify the relationships between political orientation and positive potential. This research also sought to understand how beliefs people held about human nature in the form of free will beliefs related to both positive potential and political orientation. The results of two studies suggest that conservatives and high free will believers tend to perceive the present as being better, but they also perceived less positive potential for society. The studies also identified how some conservatives may perceive the best possible future as being less ideal than liberals. Overall, the results showed that positive potential significantly related to other important variables, such as support or opposition to various political policies and the types of personal values people endorse.
