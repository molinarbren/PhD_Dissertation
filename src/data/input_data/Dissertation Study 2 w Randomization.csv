I see starving elderly the most. Men 6.4 at 100-125 pounds if they are lucky and I think, ""How the Fudge Ripple did that happen?"" When did it become OKAY? We have a Federal Mandate that says you only have to be a US citizen in order to get Cal Fresh / Food Stamps, but these elderly people are denied basic food for life. I am literally seeing them die in the street - mere skeletons. There is a crime being committed from what the Feds are mandating and what the state counties are doing with it.

That has been happening for decades. It has zero to do with Trump or Obama. 

But Houston, we have a problem.

I grew up in the military. If someone wasn't good at their job, they got tested and moved to a new job. This is nuts.",39733,WorstFutureSociety|BestFutureSociety|PresentSociety,FreeWillSurvey|PoliticalIssues/Policies,Optimism|Administration|ValuesSuvey|Gov

In fact, the survey actually appears as you're fishing for specific answers with your overly broad choices -- for example, 1) gun ownership. It would be better to have ""impose gun ownership restrictions"" since many people like me don't mind one having a gun or a rifle but would really like to see some restrictions enacted; and 2) minimum wage should be put as ""living wage"" -- very few people are against the concept of minimum wage, but many people are against the very low minimum wage that now stands but your questionnaire won't get people's clear opinion on that.
